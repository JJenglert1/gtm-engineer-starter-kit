# Research Brief: Growthly

**Date:** 02/21/26
**Researcher:** Claude Code
**Status:** Ready for outreach

---

## Company Snapshot

Growthly (growthly.io) builds a retention platform for e-commerce brands, combining cohort analytics, automated win-back campaigns, and loyalty program tooling. Customers are primarily mid-market DTC brands doing $10M-$100M in revenue. Series B stage, ~180 employees (up from ~110 six months ago), based in Austin, TX. Estimated $18-24M ARR.

## Recent Trigger

**Series B raised — $28M** (announced 02/10/26, led by Baseline Ventures). Press release emphasizes "scaling go-to-market" as the primary use of funds. Combined with 12 open sales roles on LinkedIn (6 AEs, 4 SDRs, 2 Sales Managers, all posted in the last 3 weeks) and a new VP Marketing hire (started January 2026), this signals a major GTM buildout happening right now.

## Likely Pain

1. **Scaling outbound without a structured research process.** Going from 4 reps to 16 means the "founder does the research" model breaks. They need a way to generate quality prospect intelligence at volume.
2. **Onboarding new reps with account context.** With 10 new sales hires incoming, ramping them fast requires giving them company research and talk tracks on day one — not asking them to Google for 30 minutes before each call.
3. **Maintaining outreach quality at scale.** Sarah's Outreach.io background means she knows generic sequences underperform. But handcrafting every email doesn't scale to a team of 16.

## Tech Stack

- **CRM:** Salesforce Enterprise (confirmed via job postings)
- **Marketing Automation:** HubSpot (confirmed via website)
- **CDP:** Segment (confirmed via job postings)
- **Data Warehouse:** Snowflake (confirmed via job postings)
- **Sales Intelligence:** No tooling mentioned in any job descriptions — potential gap

## Stakeholder Notes

**Sarah Chen, VP of Sales** — 18 months in role (joined August 2024). Previously Senior Director of Sales at Outreach.io for 3 years. UCLA Anderson MBA. Active on LinkedIn, posting 2-3x/month about scaling sales teams. Posts focus on repeatable process and "selling with context, not volume." She built the sales org from scratch pre-Series A, so she understands the pain of scaling firsthand. Her Outreach.io background means she won't be impressed by surface-level pitches.

## Proposed Hook

Lead with the hiring surge (publicly visible, shows you did your homework). Connect it to the challenge of maintaining pipeline quality while tripling team size. Position around "structured research that scales with headcount" rather than product features.

**Do NOT lead with:** the funding announcement alone (every vendor is emailing about that).

## ICP Scorecard

| Category | Score | Max | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Firmographic Fit | 35 | 40 | Industry match (SaaS, strong), size in range (180), geo match (US). Revenue slightly below top range. |
| Technographic Fit | 16 | 20 | Uses Salesforce + HubSpot (compatible). No sales intelligence tooling yet (opportunity). |
| Intent/Behavioral | 21 | 25 | No direct website visits detected, but actively hiring for roles that signal need. Category research unknown. |
| Trigger Events | 15 | 15 | Perfect score — $28M funding in last 30 days + 12 open sales roles + new VP Marketing. |
| **Total** | **87** | **100** | |

**Tier: A — Immediate outreach.**

**Recommendation:** Strong fit across all four categories with an exceptionally strong trigger signal. Reach out this week while the hiring surge is still fresh and Sarah is actively building.
