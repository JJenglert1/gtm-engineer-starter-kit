## Company Snapshot

- **Growthly** — Series B SaaS ($28M raised 02/10/26), ~180 employees
- Retention platform for mid-market e-commerce brands ($10-100M revenue)
- Hiring 12 sales roles: 6 AEs, 4 SDRs, 2 Sales Managers
- Current sales team: ~8 reps (about to nearly triple)
- Stack: Salesforce, HubSpot, Segment, Snowflake — no sales intelligence tooling detected

## Person Snapshot: Sarah Chen

- VP of Sales, 18 months in role — she built this sales org from zero
- Previously Senior Director at Outreach.io (3 years) — deep sales tooling knowledge
- MBA from UCLA Anderson
- LinkedIn posts emphasize process-driven selling and "context over volume"
- **Key insight from her reply:** She's already thinking about onboarding quality. You don't need to create urgency — it exists.

## Hypothesis of Pain

Three specific problems Sarah is likely facing, with evidence:

1. **New reps will default to generic outbound without a research system.**
   - *Evidence:* 6 AEs starting next month. At Outreach.io, Sarah saw what high-volume-low-quality outbound looks like. She'll want to avoid that at Growthly.

2. **The "tribal knowledge" problem — account context lives in people's heads.**
   - *Evidence:* Small founding team built relationships manually. That context doesn't transfer when you hand a new AE a list of 200 accounts and say "go."

3. **Sarah personally can't review every email once the team is 16 people.**
   - *Evidence:* Her "context over volume" philosophy works at 4-8 reps. At 16, she needs the system to enforce quality — she can't be the bottleneck.

## Anchor Questions

Use these to guide the conversation. Don't read them verbatim — let them flow naturally.

1. **"You mentioned onboarding your first big AE cohort next month — what does the ramp plan look like today for getting them up to speed on accounts?"**
   - *Why:* Opens with her words. Gets her describing current state so you understand the gap.

2. **"When your best rep preps for a call right now, what does that process actually look like?"**
   - *Why:* Surfaces the informal research habits that exist today. The answer reveals whether there's a system or just individual effort.

3. **"As you go from 8 reps to 20, what's the thing that worries you most about outbound quality?"**
   - *Why:* Lets her name the pain in her own words. Much stronger than you telling her what she should be worried about.

4. **"At Outreach.io, you probably saw a bunch of teams scale through this same inflection point — what worked and what didn't?"**
   - *Why:* Draws on her expertise. People love sharing hard-won lessons, and her answer will tell you what she's trying to replicate or avoid.

5. **"If your new AEs could walk into day one with structured research on every account in their book — what would that change about how you think about ramp?"**
   - *Why:* Future-state question. Gets her imagining the outcome without you pitching features.

## Competitive Notes

- **No direct sales intelligence tool detected** in job postings or tech stack. This is net-new budget, not a rip-and-replace. Expect longer sales cycle but no incumbent to displace.
- **Salesforce + HubSpot** already in place — any solution needs to fit within that stack, not ask them to add another system of record.
- Sarah's Outreach.io background means she'll benchmark against tools she's already used. Be prepared for "how is this different from what Outreach does?" and have a clear answer.

## Desired Outcome

By the end of this 30-minute call:

1. **Confirm the pain is real and prioritized.** Sarah's reply suggests it is — validate that with specifics (timeline, budget signal, who else is involved).
2. **Understand the buying process.** Is Sarah the decision-maker, or does this go to a CRO/CEO? What's the procurement process at a 180-person Series B startup?
3. **Agree on a next step.** Ideal: a second call with Sarah + one of her Sales Managers to discuss what rep onboarding looks like tactically. Fallback: send a tailored one-pager she can share internally.

**Do NOT try to demo or close on this call.** The goal is discovery. She extended from 15 to 30 minutes — she's interested. Don't rush it.
