**Status:** Draft — ready for review

## Email 1: The Trigger Open

**Subject:** Growthly's 12 new sales hires
**Send day:** Day 1 (Tuesday AM)

> Sarah —
>
> Saw Growthly is hiring 12 sales roles off the back of the Series B — congrats on the round.
>
> Tripling a sales team is exciting, but the part nobody warns you about is pipeline quality. When you go from 4 reps to 16 who are still ramping, outbound gets generic fast.
>
> Would 15 minutes next week make sense to see if we can help with that?
>
> — [Your name]

**Word count:** 64

### Why this works

- **Trigger-first, not product-first.** Opens with something Sarah actually cares about right now (hiring), not a feature list.
- **Names the pain before the solution.** "Pipeline quality drops when you scale" is a real thing she's likely already thinking about.
- **No false urgency.** Doesn't manufacture a deadline. The CTA is low-commitment ("15 minutes" + "if that's relevant").
- **Under 80 words.** Gets in, makes the point, gets out. No product pitch, no feature dump.
- **No jargon.** No "leveraging AI-powered insights" or "revolutionizing your GTM motion."

## Email 2: The Insight Share

**Subject:** Re: Growthly's 12 new sales hires
**Send day:** Day 4 (Friday AM)

> Sarah —
>
> One pattern we see with teams scaling past 10 reps: the top performers quietly do 15-20 minutes of account research before every call. The new hires don't — and the gap shows up in reply rates within the first month.
>
> The fix isn't "more training." It's building the research step into the workflow so it happens automatically, whether a rep has been there 3 years or 3 weeks.
>
> Given your Outreach.io background, I imagine you've seen this play out before. Happy to share what we're seeing work at similar-stage companies if helpful.
>
> — [Your name]

**Word count:** 103

### Why this works

- **Leads with an insight, not a follow-up nudge.** Gives Sarah something she can use whether she replies or not.
- **"We see this pattern" framing.** Positions you as someone who works with companies like hers — not someone reading from a script.
- **References her background.** The Outreach.io mention shows research and makes it personal without being creepy.
- **Soft CTA.** "Happy to share" is less pressure than "Are you free Thursday at 2pm?"

## Email 3: The Warm Breakup

**Subject:** Re: Growthly's 12 new sales hires
**Send day:** Day 7 (Monday AM)

> Sarah —
>
> I'll keep this short. I know February is probably hectic with the new hires ramping and Series B priorities stacking up.
>
> If scaling outbound quality isn't the top problem right now, totally fair — no hard feelings. But if it does come up, here's a 3-minute teardown we did on how one team kept reply rates above 12% while doubling headcount: [link]
>
> Either way, good luck with the build. Growthly's growth has been fun to watch.
>
> — [Your name]

**Word count:** 82

### Why this works

- **Acknowledges she's busy.** Doesn't pretend your email is the most important thing in her inbox.
- **Leaves value behind.** The linked teardown gives her a reason to engage on her own timeline.
- **Clean exit.** "No hard feelings" + "good luck" signals maturity. If she doesn't reply, you haven't burned the relationship.
- **Keeps the door open without begging.** She can click the link in 3 months and it still works as a warm re-entry point.

## Sequence Notes

- **Same thread:** Emails 2 and 3 reply to Email 1's thread. This increases open rates and feels like a conversation, not a campaign.
- **No "just checking in":** Every email either shares new context or gives something useful.
- **Timing:** Tuesday/Friday/Monday avoids the Monday-morning inbox flood and the Friday-afternoon dead zone.
- **If she replies:** Stop the sequence immediately. Do not send the next scheduled email. Respond personally.

*Next step: If Email 1 or 2 generates a reply, build meeting prep brief.*
