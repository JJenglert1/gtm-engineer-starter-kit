## My Target Customer

**Industries I sell to:**
- [e.g., B2B SaaS, Fintech, E-commerce, Healthcare IT]

**Company size (headcount):**
- Minimum: [e.g., 50]
- Maximum: [e.g., 500]
- Sweet spot: [e.g., 100-200]

**Revenue range:**
- [e.g., $5M - $50M ARR]

**Funding stage:**
- [e.g., Series A through Series C]

**Geography:**
- [e.g., US and Canada, English-speaking markets]

**Business model:**
- [e.g., B2B SaaS with self-serve + sales-led motion]

## My Product

**What I sell (one sentence):**
- [e.g., A pipeline acceleration tool that helps SDR teams research prospects 10x faster]

**The problem I solve:**
- [e.g., SDRs spend 3+ hours/day on manual prospect research instead of selling]

**Who buys it (title/role):**
- [e.g., VP of Sales, Head of Revenue Operations, SDR Manager]

**Compatible tech stack (tools we integrate with or complement):**
- [e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, Salesloft]

**Competitor tools (what prospects might use instead):**
- [e.g., Clay, Apollo, ZoomInfo, manual research]

## My Disqualifiers

These are deal-breakers — if a prospect has any of these, score them as Tier C:

- [e.g., Fewer than 20 employees]
- [e.g., No dedicated sales team]
- [e.g., Government / public sector (we don't sell there)]
- [e.g., Already using our product]

---

## My Best Signals

These are the triggers that tell me a company is ready to buy RIGHT NOW:

- [e.g., Just raised a funding round in the last 90 days]
- [e.g., Hiring 5+ sales roles simultaneously]
- [e.g., New VP of Sales or CRO hired in the last 6 months]
- [e.g., Posting job descriptions that mention our product category]
